```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 10242:10242 bigconnect/bigconnect-explorer
```
If you would like to persist data between runs you can supply a volume to the docker run command:
```
docker run -d -p 10242:10242 -p 8888:8888 -v /tmp/datastore:/bc/datastore bigconnect/bigconnect-explorer
```
Now, open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

Login with the following details:
- Username: **admin**
- Password **admin**

### Locally
To run the latest build you need to build the project first. You need to have Maven installed and JDK11.
```
mvn -Pbin-release clean install
```
The release artifacts are available in the ```release/target/explorer-*``` folder

##	Development

1. Use IntelliJ IDEA to import the project form existing sources (maven). Choose the project folder.
2. Create a run configuration of type Application with the following parameters:
    * Name: BC Tomcat
    * Main Class: com.mware.web.TomcatWebServer
    * VM Arguments: -DHADOOP_HOME=/opt/bdl/lib/hadoop
    * Program arguments: --webAppDir $MODULE_DIR$/../war/src/main/webapp --port 8888
    * Working directory: $MODULE_DIR$/..
    * Environment variables: BIGCONNECT_DIR=$MODULE_DIR$/..
    * Use classpath of module: bc-tomcat-server
    * FOR JDK 11: VM arguments: --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED

4. Start the "BC Tomcat" run configuration

###	JavaScript Development instructions
0. Run <code>npm install</code> in war/src/main/webapp
1. If changes are made to the <b>package.json</b> file you need to run <i>mvn compile</i> from the <i>project</i>/web/war folder
2. To compile all JavaScript and Less files run <i>grunt</i> from the <i>project</i>/web/war/src/main/webapp folder
3. After all files are compiled, you can start the <i>watch.cmd</i> utility from the <i>project</i>/web/war/src/main/webapp folder to scan for filesystem changes

    Note: While the watch utility is running, any change to less, hbs, ejs, js and jsx files will be automatically compiled.
    To see your changes, just refresh the browser window. This process can be run while the application is running.

4. <b>Do NOT commit</b> files from the <b>css</b> and <b>jsc</b> folders. These folders are generated by the grunt compilation tasks.
